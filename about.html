  <h3>Our History</h3>
  <p>Founded in 2015 by two friends who loved books and conversation, Simply Revived began with a small curated selection and a kettle on the stove. Over the years we expanded into a welcoming space with a café corner, local author events, and community initiatives.</p>

  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>To inspire a love for reading and community by offering a curated selection of books and a cosy space where stories, coffee and connection come together.</p>

  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>To be the go-to neighbourhood bookstore and café where people of all ages discover new ideas, enjoy meaningful conversations, and revive the simple joy of books and togetherness.</p>
