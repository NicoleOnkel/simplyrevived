  <h2>About Simply Revived</h2>
  <p>Simply Revived began as a small neighbourhood bookstore with a simple aim: to rekindle the love of reading and build a local place where people can connect over stories and coffee.</p>

  <h3>Our History</h3>
  <p>Founded in 2015 by two book lovers, Simply Revived started on a modest street corner with second-hand books, a few armchairs and a kettle on. Over time the shop found its voice — hosting local author evenings, supporting reading circles for kids, and becoming a comfortable place where students and remote workers stop by for a quiet hour.</p>

  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>To inspire a love of reading and nurture community by offering a carefully curated selection of books and a warm café space where conversations and ideas flourish.</p>

  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>To be the go-to neighbourhood bookstore and café that celebrates stories, supports local writers, and creates memorable moments for readers of all ages.</p>

  <h3>Values</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Community:</strong> We host events and programs that bring people together.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Books and events available to a wide and diverse audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We favour used books, local suppliers and low-waste packaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> We champion new voices and diverse perspectives.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What We Offer</h3>
  <p>Alongside our bookshop you’ll find a cosy café corner serving freshly brewed coffee and baked goods — perfect for reading, meeting friends, or working quietly. We stock fiction, non-fiction, children’s books, local authors and a rotating selection of staff picks.</p>

  <h3>Community Programmes</h3>
  <p>Simply Revived runs monthly reading circles, school outreach events, and author signings. We also have a small book-exchange shelf encouraging book-sharing among neighbours.</p>

  <h3>Visit Us</h3>
  <p>We’re located at 123 Book Street, Cape Town. Drop in for a browse, a chat, or a slice of cake — we’d love to meet you.</p>
